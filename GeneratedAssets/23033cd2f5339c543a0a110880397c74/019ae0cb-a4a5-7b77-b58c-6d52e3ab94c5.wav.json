    "prompt": "Create a satisfying sound effect for an Arkanoid/Breakout game where the ball hits the player paddle. The sound should be short, crisp, and have a pleasant, resonant tone. It should convey a sense of precision and accomplishment, with a subtle metallic or glassy quality, and a slight echo to emphasize the impact. The sound should not be harsh or jarring but rather smooth and enjoyable",
